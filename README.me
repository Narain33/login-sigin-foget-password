# User Registration and Login System

This project is a basic user registration and login system implemented using PHP and MySQL. It allows users to create accounts, log in, and reset their passwords if forgotten. The system is built using HTML for the front-end, and PHP for handling server-side logic and database interactions. 

## Features

1. **User Registration:** Users can create accounts by providing their personal information such as first name, last name, username, password, gender, city, state, and pin code.

2. **Login:** Registered users can log into their accounts using their username and password.

3. **Password Reset:** The system includes a password reset mechanism that allows users to reset their password if forgotten.

## Files

1. **config.php:** Contains database configuration constants and establishes a connection to the MySQL database.

2. **forgetpswd.php:** Allows users to reset their password by verifying their email and updating the password in the database.

3. **loginform.php:** Provides a login form for users to enter their credentials and log in.

4. **login.php:** Validates user credentials and logs them in if they are correct.

5. **insert.php:** Handles the registration process by inserting user data into the database.

6. **regist.php:** Displays a user registration form for users to create accounts.

## Setup

1. **Database Configuration:** Update the `DB_SERVER`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_DATABASE` constants in `config.php` with your MySQL database credentials.

2. **Web Server:** Host the files on a web server with PHP and MySQL support (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a live web server).

3. **Database Setup:** Create a database named `test` (or modify the database name as needed) in your MySQL server.

4. **Table Creation:** Create a table named `info` in the database with columns corresponding to the user information (e.g., `id`, `fname`, `lname`, `uname`, `pass`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`).

5. **Run the Application:** Access the `regist.php` file in your browser to register users. Access the `loginform.php` file to log in and use the system.
